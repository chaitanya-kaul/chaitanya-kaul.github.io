Overview
======

I am presently working as a Research Associate in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow in [Prof. Roderick Murray-Smith's](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~rod/) team on the [iCaird](https://icaird.com/) project. My work involves investigating the privacy risks involved in exporting large scale machine learning models out of AI Safe Havens and detection of possible data as well as sensitive feature leakage in AI systems. I am also a Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow, where I teach modules on Data Programming in Python and Large Scale Computing for Data Analytics. I also supervise M.Sc. projects in the areas of Deep Learning, Medical Imaging and Stastical Machine Learning. 

I did my Ph.D. at the Department of Computer Science in the University of York under the guidance of [Dr Nick Pears](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/np7/) and [Dr Suresh Manandhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sureshmanandhar/?originalSubdomain=uk). my Ph.D. involved creating novel Deep Learning architectures for solving Medical Imaging and 3D Shape Analysis tasks using visual attention.
